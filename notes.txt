React notes


MODULE 3


It uses JSX to return HTML components.

Components make up the whole application or page in react

Each react is basically some HTML which is returned through a function

JSX is the syntax through which we can wrote HTML in JS files

Each sepparate component is stored in a separeate file and that is a rule

Only the root element is rendered directly to the page and the rest and inside one or another ()
nesting

One important rule is that each component should only have one ROOT 
which means that only one parent should be there in a component


each component has its separate css file generally and the css file is imported in the compnent.js file
 in the component file in jsx syntax in HTML elements class is written as className and this className
is taken from the respective css file


as in JS we had ${} in which we can write JS expressions in jSX react we have {} here we can write expressions
or variable names and the value of the those would be used inside the tags

React also has feature called PROPS , it is used to send data between components, as data is needed
to make the page dynamic so data is sent through props by putting it in {}, data is sent as key value pairs
and a single object recives all of it in the receiving functions arguments
